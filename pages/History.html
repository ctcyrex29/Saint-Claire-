                St Claire is a charitable organization which aims at offering assistance,promotes
                advanced education,provides emotional support and raise awareness of self and others
                amongst girls as they are the future of the world.We take St Claire, commonly known
                as St Claire of Assisi as our inspiration,in that she did not only choose to serve God
                but, she also took it upon herself to leave behind all the luxuries of this world to go
                and dwell amongst other ladies and share with them a part of herself.
                <br> <br> And because of
                that we will celebrate her every 11th day of August each year.And it is our hope that as
                she attracted other women,we also do that and grow our organization, a legacy for
                women.
            
                Who does St Claire target?We offer our services to any girl who is need of any of the
                services we provide, for we know what it is to have and not have (Philipians 4:12).In
                order to be able to reach out to these girls and provide services to them, we have
                devised safe ways to find funds, hence our set target will all be met.It is in the interest
                of reaching the whole world that we will create an app in order to spread
                awareness,attract well wishers,those in need of our services, and send updates about
                our organization.
                <br> <br>
                We will also be available on different social media networks.
                We are confident in ourselves,proud to offer ourselves in hope of bringing light to the
                world through charity.By putting a smile on others we also find ours.St
                Claire,preaching Philautia,Agape (self love,selfless love).St Claire,help a girl
                child,bless the world!!
